## 💡 Important Recommendations

### Before Choosing Modules:
- ✅ Clarify your project ideas first
- ✅ Understand what you want to build
- ✅ Consider aiming for **more than 14 points** (as a safety buffer)

### Why aim higher?
If some modules aren't validated during evaluation, having extra points ensures you still meet the requirement.

## ⚠️ Critical - Module Dependencies

### 🎮 Gaming Module Dependencies

**These modules require at least one game to be implemented first:**
- AI Opponent
- Tournament system
- Game customization
- Spectator mode
- Multiplayer 3+ players
- Add another game
- Game Statistics module

### 💬 Chat Dependencies

- **Advanced chat features** require the basic chat functionality from the "User interaction" module

### 🚫 Incompatibilities

- **SSR is incompatible** with the ICP blockchain backend

## 📝 Planning Tips

1. **Map dependencies** before selecting modules
2. **Ensure coherence** - modules should work together logically
3. **Consider complexity** - some combinations are harder than others
4. **Plan implementation order** - build foundational modules first

---

## 🎯 Evaluation Rules

> **During evaluation, you will be asked to demonstrate each claimed module.**

### Scoring:
- ✅ **Fully functional and properly implemented** = Full points
- ❌ **Non-functional or incomplete** = 0 points

### Important:
Only modules that are **completely working** will count toward your final score. No partial credit!

## 🌟 Success Strategy

1. Choose modules that complement each other
2. Start with core functionality
3. Add complexity gradually
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document everything
6. Prepare demonstrations for evaluation
